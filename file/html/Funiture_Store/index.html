                <p class="des">Featuring an air hockey surface as well as a pool one, this table is made of manufactured wood with a polyester felt top. It has a deep brown finish with a traditional bright green top and a smooth surface for dining.

                    Due to the dark finish of this table, we recommend it for a room that has high ceilings and plenty of natural light. Beige or white walls would provide a natural contrast, as would a taupe rug underneath for a warm neutral finish. If your dining room is narrow, we advise against a dark finish, as it could make a room appear even smaller.</p>
